- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin Warren
- 👀 I’m interested in developing a more specific career path. I've been a generalist for the last 20 years and am looking to focus on data analytics for the last half of my career. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting involved with more complex analysis. I've dealt with small datasets and reporting throughout my career, but would like to develop more skills in cleaning, analyzing, and presenting. 
- 📫 How to reach me: justin.t.warren@gmail.com
